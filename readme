# StrongDog-like Static Site (no movies)

This repository contains a minimal static website inspired by strongdog.xp but without any movie content. It focuses on short posts, links, images, and a retro/neon aesthetic.

Features
- Responsive single-page layout
- Hero section and navigation
- Grid of cards for posts (no video or movie embeds)
- About and contact sections
- Theme toggle (dark / light)
- Easy to deploy on GitHub Pages or any static host

How to use
1. Clone or copy the files to a new repository.
2. Customize content in `index.html`.
3. Optionally replace placeholder images with your own in an `assets/` folder.
4. Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (branch `main`, folder `/`).

Files included
